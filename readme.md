Python standard library code examples using AI

This application generates code examples for Python's standard library modules using AI. It organizes the examples into markdown files categorized by the module's functionality.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
2. Make sure the `ollama` service is running.
3. Run the `main.py` script to generate the code examples.
4. The generated markdown files will be saved in the `standard_library_documents` directory.
5. If files already exist, they will not be replaced or processed. You can delete the existing files and run the program again to regenerate them.
6. You can add more modules to the standard library dictionary to generate examples for additional modules.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.12
- `ollama` library for AI-based code generation

## Installing Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Reading the Generated Documents

You can read the generated documents in the `standard_library_documents` folder.
