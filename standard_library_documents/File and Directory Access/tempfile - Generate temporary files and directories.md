# tempfile â€” Generate temporary files and directories

**Tempfile Module Example**
================================

The `tempfile` module provides functions to create temporary files, directories, etc.

### Creating Temporary Files

You can use the `TemporaryFile` class to create a new file that is automatically deleted when it is closed.
```python
import tempfile

# Create a temporary file
with tempfile.TemporaryFile() as temp_file:
    # Write data to the file
    temp_file.write(b'Hello, world!')
    
    # Check if there's any remaining data in the file
    assert not temp_file.tell()

# The file is now deleted
```

### Creating Temporary Directories

You can use the `TemporaryDirectory` class to create a new directory that is automatically deleted when it is closed.
```python
import tempfile

# Create a temporary directory
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
    # Write some files in the directory
    with open(f'{temp_dir}/file1.txt', 'w') as file1:
        file1.write('Hello, world!')
    
    with open(f'{temp_dir}/file2.txt', 'w') as file2:
        file2.write('Goodbye, world!')

# The directory is now deleted
```

### Creating Named Temporary Files

You can use the `NamedTemporaryFile` class to create a new file that is automatically deleted when it is closed.
```python
import tempfile

# Create a named temporary file
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as temp_file:
    # Write data to the file
    temp_file.write(b'Hello, world!')
    
    # Check if there's any remaining data in the file
    assert not temp_file.tell()

# The file is now deleted
```

### Creating Named Temporary Files with Prefix and Suffix

You can use the `NamedTemporaryFile` class with a prefix and suffix to create a new file that is automatically deleted when it is closed.
```python
import tempfile

# Create a named temporary file with a prefix and suffix
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(prefix='tmp_', suffix='.txt') as temp_file:
    # Write data to the file
    temp_file.write(b'Hello, world!')
    
    # Check if there's any remaining data in the file
    assert not temp_file.tell()

# The file is now deleted
```

### Creating Pseudo-Temporary Files

You can use the `PseudoTemporaryFile` class to create a new file that will be deleted when the file descriptor is closed, regardless of whether it is explicitly closed or an exception occurs.
```python
import tempfile

# Create a pseudo-temporary file
with tempfile.PseudoTemporaryFile() as temp_file:
    # Write data to the file
    temp_file.write(b'Hello, world!')
    
    # Check if there's any remaining data in the file
    assert not temp_file.tell()

# The file is now deleted
```

### Creating Pseudo-Temporary Directories

You can use the `PseudoTemporaryDirectory` class to create a new directory that will be deleted when the directory descriptor is closed, regardless of whether it is explicitly closed or an exception occurs.
```python
import tempfile

# Create a pseudo-temporary directory
with tempfile.PseudoTemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
    # Write some files in the directory
    with open(f'{temp_dir}/file1.txt', 'w') as file1:
        file1.write('Hello, world!')
    
    with open(f'{temp_dir}/file2.txt', 'w') as file2:
        file2.write('Goodbye, world!')

# The directory is now deleted
```

### Getting the Current Temporary File

You can use the `gettempdir()` function to get the current temporary file path.
```python
import tempfile

print(tempfile.gettempdir())
```

### Getting the Name of a Temporary File

You can use the `gettempdir()` function and then join the directory path with a filename to get the name of a temporary file.
```python
import tempfile

print(tempfile.gettempdir() + '/tmp_file.txt')
```

### Creating a Temporary File with Specific Permissions

You can use the `TemporaryFile` class with the `delete=False` argument and then use the `os.chmod()` function to set specific permissions on the file.
```python
import os
import tempfile

# Create a temporary file
with tempfile.TemporaryFile() as temp_file:
    # Write data to the file
    temp_file.write(b'Hello, world!')
    
    # Set specific permissions on the file
    os.chmod(temp_file.name, 0o644)

# The file is now deleted
```

### Creating a Temporary Directory with Specific Permissions

You can use the `TemporaryDirectory` class with the `delete=False` argument and then use the `os.chmod()` function to set specific permissions on the directory.
```python
import os
import tempfile

# Create a temporary directory
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
    # Set specific permissions on the directory
    os.chmod(temp_dir, 0o755)

# The directory is now deleted
```

### Creating a Named Temporary File with Specific Prefix and Suffix

You can use the `NamedTemporaryFile` class with the `prefix` and `suffix` arguments to create a temporary file that meets specific naming requirements.
```python
import tempfile

# Create a named temporary file with a specific prefix and suffix
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(prefix='tmp_', suffix='.txt') as temp_file:
    # Write data to the file
    temp_file.write(b'Hello, world!')
    
    # Check if there's any remaining data in the file
    assert not temp_file.tell()

# The file is now deleted
```

### Creating a Named Temporary File with Specific Mode

You can use the `NamedTemporaryFile` class with the `mode` argument to create a temporary file that meets specific permissions.
```python
import tempfile

# Create a named temporary file with specific mode
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w') as temp_file:
    # Write data to the file
    temp_file.write(b'Hello, world!')
    
    # Check if there's any remaining data in the file
    assert not temp_file.tell()

# The file is now deleted
```

### Creating a Named Temporary Directory with Specific Mode

You can use the `TemporaryDirectory` class with the `mode` argument to create a temporary directory that meets specific permissions.
```python
import tempfile

# Create a named temporary directory with specific mode
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory(mode='w') as temp_dir:
    # Write some files in the directory
    with open(f'{temp_dir}/file1.txt', 'w') as file1:
        file1.write('Hello, world!')
    
    with open(f'{temp_dir}/file2.txt', 'w') as file2:
        file2.write('Goodbye, world!')

# The directory is now deleted
```
