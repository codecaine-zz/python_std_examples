The `urllib` module in Python is a comprehensive set of modules that provide tools for interacting with URLs. The `response` submodule contains several response classes used by the `urllib` modules to handle HTTP responses. These classes are part of the `http.client` module, which provides an interface to HTTP clients.

Below are examples demonstrating various functionalities related to the `Response` classes in the `urllib.response` module:

```python
import urllib.request

def fetch_url(url):
    try:
        # Create a request object using urlopen with default settings
        response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
        
        # Read the content of the response
        content = response.read()
        
        # Print the length of the content
        print(f"Content length: {len(content)} bytes")
        
        # Decode the content to a string
        decoded_content = content.decode('utf-8')
        print("Decoded Content:")
        print(decoded_content)
    except urllib.error.URLError as e:
        # Handle errors that occur during the request
        print(f"An error occurred: {e.reason}")
    finally:
        # Close the response to free up resources
        if response:
            response.close()

# Example usage of fetch_url function
fetch_url("https://www.example.com")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Importing `urllib.request`:** 
   - This module provides a high-level interface for opening URLs and retrieving data from them.

2. **Function `fetch_url(url)`**:
   - Takes a URL as input.
   - Uses `urllib.request.urlopen()` to open the URL. This function returns an HTTPResponse object.
   - Reads the content of the response using the `.read()` method, which returns bytes data.
   - Decodes the content from bytes to a string using UTF-8 encoding and prints it.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - The `try-except` block catches any `URLError` that might occur during the request (e.g., network issues).
   - Prints an error message if an exception is caught.

4. **Resource Management:**
   - The `finally` block ensures that the response is closed using `.close()`, even if an error occurs, to free up system resources.

### Additional Features:

- **Response Code and Headers:**
  You can access the HTTP status code and headers of a response using the `.getcode()` and `.getheaders()` methods respectively.

```python
def fetch_url_with_details(url):
    try:
        response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
        
        # Get the HTTP status code
        http_status_code = response.getcode()
        print(f"HTTP Status Code: {http_status_code}")
        
        # Get and print all headers
        headers = response.getheaders()
        for header, value in headers:
            print(f"{header}: {value}")
    except urllib.error.URLError as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e.reason}")
    finally:
        if response:
            response.close()

# Example usage of fetch_url_with_details function
fetch_url_with_details("https://www.example.com")
```

- **Streaming Responses:**
  You can also process responses in a streaming manner using the `.readline()` or `.readinto()` methods.

```python
def stream_data(url):
    try:
        response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
        
        # Read and print each line of the response
        while True:
            line = response.readline()
            if not line:
                break
            print(line.decode('utf-8'), end='')
    except urllib.error.URLError as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e.reason}")
    finally:
        if response:
            response.close()

# Example usage of stream_data function
stream_data("https://www.example.com")
```

These examples demonstrate the basic functionalities of using the `Response` classes in the `urllib.response` module, including how to handle requests, access response details, and manage resources effectively.
