# getpass - Portable password input

The `getpass` module in the Python standard library provides a way to prompt for passwords securely without echoing them on the screen. This is particularly useful for applications that need to handle user credentials, such as web servers or command-line interfaces.

Here are comprehensive code examples for each functionality provided by the `getpass` module:

```python
import getpass

# Example 1: Prompting for a password without echoing it
def prompt_for_password():
    """
    Prompts the user to enter their password securely.
    
    Returns:
        str: The password entered by the user.
    """
    try:
        # Use getpass.getpass() to prompt for password input and ensure it is not echoed on screen
        password = getpass.getpass("Enter your password: ")
        return password
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nPassword entry aborted.")
        return None

# Example 2: Prompting for a password with echo enabled (used for compatibility)
def prompt_for_password_echo_enabled():
    """
    Prompts the user to enter their password with echoing enabled.
    
    Returns:
        str: The password entered by the user.
    """
    try:
        # Use getpass.getpass() without any options to enable echoing
        password = getpass.getpass("Enter your password (will be displayed): ")
        return password
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nPassword entry aborted.")
        return None

# Example 3: Prompting for a password with the `curses` module support
def prompt_for_password_curses():
    """
    Prompts the user to enter their password securely using the curses library.
    
    Returns:
        str: The password entered by the user.
    """
    try:
        # Import necessary functions from getpass and curses modules
        import curses
        
        # Initialize a new screen session
        stdscr = curses.initscr()
        
        # Use getpass.getpass() with a custom prompt for curses interface
        password = getpass.curses_getpass("Enter your password: ")
        
        # Restore the terminal to its original state
        curses.endwin()
        
        return password
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None

# Example 4: Prompting for a username without echoing it
def prompt_for_username():
    """
    Prompts the user to enter their username securely.
    
    Returns:
        str: The username entered by the user.
    """
    try:
        # Use getpass.getuser() to get the current logged-in user's username
        username = getpass.getuser()
        return username
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None

# Example 5: Prompting for a password using different methods and combining them
def prompt_for_secure_password():
    """
    Demonstrates multiple ways to prompt for a secure password.
    
    Returns:
        str: The password entered by the user, or None if aborted.
    """
    try:
        # Use getpass.getpass() in one of the above examples and print the result
        print("Using default getpass function:")
        password = prompt_for_password()
        
        # Prompt for password with echo enabled
        print("\nPrompting with echo enabled:")
        password_echo_enabled = prompt_for_password_echo_enabled()
        
        # Prompt for password using curses interface
        print("\nPrompting using curses interface:")
        password_curses = prompt_for_password_curses()
        
        # Prompt for username securely
        print("\nPrompting for a username:")
        username = prompt_for_username()
        
        return (password, password_echo_enabled, password_curses, username)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage of the functions
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Call the function to demonstrate multiple password prompt methods
    secure_passwords = prompt_for_secure_password()
    
    if secure_passwords is not None:
        for i, password in enumerate(secure_passwords):
            if password is not None:
                print(f"Result {i+1}: {password}")
```

### Explanation:

- **`prompt_for_password()`**: Prompts the user to enter a password securely by using `getpass.getpass()`. This function handles the input without displaying it on the screen.

- **`prompt_for_password_echo_enabled()`**: Demonstrates prompting for a password with echoing enabled, which is useful for compatibility reasons if needed.

- **`prompt_for_password_curses()`**: Uses the `curses` library to prompt securely, providing a more modern interface. This function initializes a new screen session and then restores it after the input is collected.

- **`prompt_for_username()`**: Retrieves the current logged-in user's username using `getpass.getuser()`.

- **`prompt_for_secure_password()`**: Combines multiple methods of prompting for secure passwords, demonstrating their usage in one function call.

- **Example Usage**: The script calls these functions and prints the results to demonstrate how each method works. This is useful for understanding and verifying the functionality of the `getpass` module.
