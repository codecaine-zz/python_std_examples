# curses.panel â€” A panel stack extension for curses

**Curses Panel Module**
======================

The `curses.panel` module provides an interface to create and manage panels, which are regions of a window that can be displayed independently.

### Creating Panels
-------------------

A panel is created using the `panel` function, which takes two arguments: the current window and the panel type. The panel type can be either `PALL`, which stands for "all", or a specific attribute (e.g., `PAD`, which stands for "absolute double buffering").

```python
# Import the curses module and the panel class
import curses

# Initialize the curses window
stdscr = curses.initscr()
curses.noecho()
curses.curs_set(0)  # Hide the cursor

# Create a new panel on top of the standard window
pall = curses.newwin(10, 20, 0, 0, 'PALL')

# Set the title of the panel
pall.addstr(1, 1, "Panel Title")
pall.refresh()

# Wait for user input and then clean up
curses.napms(1000)
curses.endwin()
```

### Panel Stack
----------------

A panel stack is a sequence of panels that can be stacked on top of each other. Each panel in the stack can have its own title, and the stack can be manipulated using various methods.

```python
# Create another panel on top of the original one
pall2 = curses.newwin(10, 20, 0, 0, 'PALL')

# Add a new string to the second panel
pall2.addstr(1, 1, "New String")

# Set the title of the second panel
pall2.set_title("Panel Title 2")

# Stack the two panels on top of each other
stack = curses.newstack()
stack.push(pall)
stack.push(pall2)

# Refresh the stacked panels
stack.refresh()

# Wait for user input and then clean up
curses.napms(1000)
curses.endwin()
```

### Panel Methods
-----------------

The `curses.panel` class provides several methods that can be used to manipulate panels. These include:

*   `set_title`: sets the title of a panel
*   `addstr`: adds a new string to a panel
*   `refresh`: refreshes the contents of a panel
*   `push`: pushes a panel onto a stack
*   `pop`: pops the top panel from a stack

```python
# Create a new panel and add some text to it
p = curses.newwin(10, 20, 0, 0)
p.addstr(1, 1, "Hello World")

# Set the title of the panel
p.set_title("My Panel")
```

### Example Use Cases
----------------------

*   Creating a GUI application with multiple panels that can be displayed independently.
*   Implementing a text editor with multiple views for different parts of the document.
*   Building a graphical user interface (GUI) with separate panels for menus, buttons, and other controls.

Note: The above code examples are just a starting point, and you may need to modify them to suit your specific requirements. Additionally, this is not an exhaustive list of all methods provided by the `curses.panel` module.
