# select - Waiting for I/O completion

**Select Method Example**
==========================

The `select` method is used to wait for I/O operations on multiple file descriptors.

### Code
```python
import os
import time

def main():
    # Create file descriptors
    fd1 = open('file1.txt', 'w')
    fd2 = open('file2.txt', 'r')
    fd3 = os.open('file3.txt', os.O_RDONLY)

    # Set timeout for select
    timeout = 5

    # Use select to wait for I/O operations
    readable, writable, errored = select(fd1.fileno(), fd2.fileno(), [], [], timeout)

    if readable:
        print("Readable: File is ready for reading")
        data = os.read(fd1.fileno(), 1024)
        print(f"Received {len(data)} bytes from file1")

    if writable:
        print("Writable: File is ready for writing")
        data = b'Hello, World!'
        write_bytes = os.write(fd2.fileno(), data)
        print(f"Wrote {write_bytes} bytes to file2")

    if errored:
        print("Errored: I/O operation has failed")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

*   We create three file descriptors `fd1`, `fd2`, and `fd3` for a write-only, read-only, and read-only files respectively.
*   We set a timeout of 5 seconds using the `select` function.
*   The first argument to `select` is a list of readable file descriptors. Since we are only interested in reading from `fd1`, we pass it as an empty list.
*   The second argument is a list of writable file descriptors, which is also empty since we are not writing to any files.
*   The third argument is a list of errored file descriptors, which will be populated if the I/O operation fails for any reason.
*   If there are readable or writable file descriptors, `select` will wait until the timeout is reached or an I/O operation completes.

### Example Use Cases

*   Wait for network responses
*   Wait for user input
*   Wait for keyboard events
*   Wait for disk I/O completion
