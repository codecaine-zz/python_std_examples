**Usage**
```bash
$ python cmd.py
Result: hello
Result: world!
Result: invalid line
Exception: CommandError: Processing error: SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
```
This implementation provides a basic command interpreter that can process lines of input. It includes the following features:

*   A `CommandInterpreter` class that manages the processing of individual lines.
*   A `_process_line` context manager that handles any errors that occur during line processing.
*   An `__iter__` method that yields each line of input.

Note that this is a simplified example, and you may want to add additional features such as support for command-line arguments or more complex syntax parsing.
