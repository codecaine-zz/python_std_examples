# netrc â€” netrc file processing

**Netrc File Processing in Python**
=====================================

The `netrc` module is used to parse and process netrc files, which are used by many applications to store network login credentials.

**Example Code**
---------------

```python
import netrc

def main():
    # Create a netrc object from the default location (~/.netrc)
    try:
        n = netrc.Netrc()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("No ~/.netrc file found. Using default location.")
        n = netrc.Netrc()

    # Get credentials for a specific host
    host = 'example.com'
    try:
        auth = n.authenticators(host)
    except KeyError:
        print(f"No authentication method found for {host}.")
        return

    if not isinstance(auth, list):
        print(f"Multiple authentication methods found for {host}:")
        print(auth)

    # Get a specific credential
    cred = n.passwords.get(host, None)
    if cred is not None:
        print(f"Credential for {host}: {cred}")
    else:
        print(f"No credentials found for {host}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Explanation**
---------------

1. Import the `netrc` module.
2. Create a `Netrc()` object, which represents the netrc file located at the default location (`~/.netrc`).
3. Get authentication methods for a specific host using `n.authenticators(host)`.
4. Get credentials for a specific host using `n.passwords.get(host)`.

**Other Methods**
-----------------

*   `Netrc().authenticators()`: Returns a dictionary of authentication methods.
*   `Netrc().passwords`: Returns a dictionary of password entries.
*   `Netrc().servers`: Returns a list of server names.

**Example Use Cases**
---------------------

1.  **Authenticating to an FTP Server**: Use the netrc module to store your login credentials for an FTP server, and then use the credentials to connect to the server using an FTP client or library.
2.  **Configuring SSH Connections**: Store your SSH login credentials in a netrc file, and then use the netrc module to retrieve the credentials when connecting to an SSH server.

**Note**
----

*   The `netrc` module only reads from the local file system, so be cautious about storing sensitive information in the netrc file.
*   Many applications assume that the netrc file is located at `~/.netrc`, but this can vary depending on the application.
