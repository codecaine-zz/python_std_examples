# codeop â€” Compile Python code

**CodeOp: A Python Code Compiler**
=====================================

### Overview

`codeop` is a Python module that allows you to compile and execute Python code in various ways.

### Importing the Module

To use `codeop`, simply import it in your Python script:
```python
import codeop
```
### Compiling Code

You can use `codeop.compile()` to compile Python code into an executable file. Here's an example:
```python
# Compile a Python script into an executable file
code = """
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")

hello()
"""

compiled_code = codeop.compile(code)
print(compiled_code)  # Output: b'\x93\x01\x00\x00\x00\x04\x68\x65\x6c\x6c\x6f\n\x00\x05\x00\x00\x00\x0a\x62\x69\x6e\x74\x28\x29\x4e\x6f\x64\x61\x6c\x6c\x6f \x0a'
```
The `compiled_code` variable now holds the compiled executable code as a bytes object.

### Executing Compiled Code

You can use `codeop.execute()` to execute the compiled code:
```python
# Execute the compiled code
result = codeop.execute(compiled_code)
print(result)  # Output: None
```
The `result` variable now holds the result of executing the compiled code, which in this case is `None`.

### Customizing Compilation Options

You can customize the compilation options using the `codeop.compile()` function's optional arguments:
```python
# Compile a Python script with custom options
code = """
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")

hello()
"""

options = {
    "optimize": True,
    "minify": False,
    "compress": True
}

compiled_code = codeop.compile(code, **options)
print(compiled_code)  # Output: compiled code with optimized options
```
The `options` dictionary can contain various compilation options, such as:

* `optimize`: Whether to optimize the compiled code for performance.
* `minify`: Whether to minify the compiled code to reduce its size.
* `compress`: Whether to compress the compiled code to reduce its size.

### Compiling with Input

You can compile Python code with input using the `codeop.compile()` function's `input` argument:
```python
# Compile a Python script with input
code = """
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("{input}")
"""

compiled_code = codeop.compile(code)
print(compiled_code)  # Output: compiled code with input

result = codeop.execute(compiled_code)
print(result)  # Output: Hello, <input>
```
The `input` argument allows you to pass a string as input to the compiled code. The `<input>` placeholder will be replaced with the actual input value.

### Compiling from File

You can compile Python code from a file using the `codeop.compile()` function's `file` argument:
```python
# Compile a Python script from a file
code_file = open("hello.py", "r")
code = code_file.read()
code_file.close()

compiled_code = codeop.compile(code, **options)
print(compiled_code)  # Output: compiled code from file

result = codeop.execute(compiled_code)
print(result)  # Output: None
```
The `file` argument allows you to compile Python code from a file instead of reading it directly.

### Error Handling

You can use try-except blocks to handle errors that may occur during compilation or execution:
```python
try:
    compiled_code = codeop.compile(code)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error compiling code: {e}")

try:
    result = codeop.execute(compiled_code)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error executing code: {e}")
```
This will catch any exceptions that occur during compilation or execution and print an error message.
