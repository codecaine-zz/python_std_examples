The `nis` module is an interface to Sun Microsystems' Yellow Pages (NIS) services, which were used to manage network information systems in Unix-like operating systems. While Python's support for NIS has been limited and deprecated in recent versions of the standard library due to its complexity and lack of modern alternatives like LDAP or Active Directory, I can still provide a basic example of how you might use the `nis` module if you need to interact with an NIS server.

Here's a comprehensive code example that demonstrates some common operations using the `nis` module:

```python
import nis

def main():
    # Define the domain and service for which you want to access information
    domain = 'example.com'
    service = 'passwd.byname'

    try:
        # Retrieve NIS information
        info = nis.niscat(domain, service)

        print(f"Domain: {domain}")
        print(f"Service: {service}")

        # Iterate over the entries and print them
        for entry in info:
            print(entry)

    except nis.error as e:
        # Handle errors that occur during NIS operations
        print(f"Error accessing NIS: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Import the `nis` Module**: This module provides functions to interact with NIS services.

2. **Define Domain and Service**: Specify the domain and service you want to access, such as `/etc/passwd.byname`.

3. **Retrieve NIS Information**: Use `nis.niscat()` to retrieve data from the specified NIS server and service. This function returns a list of entries in the format `[key1, value1], [key2, value2], ...`.

4. **Handle Exceptions**: Use a try-except block to handle any errors that may occur during the operation, such as connection issues or permission problems.

5. **Iterate and Print Entries**: Loop through the retrieved entries and print them out.

### Notes:

- **NIS Deprecation**: It's important to note that NIS is an outdated protocol and should not be used for new applications due to its lack of security, performance, and modern features compared to LDAP or Active Directory.
- **Alternative Solutions**: Consider using LDAP or Active Directory if you need to interact with a more robust network information system.

This example provides a basic framework for interacting with NIS services. Depending on your specific requirements, you might need to extend this code to handle more complex scenarios or integrate it into a larger application.
