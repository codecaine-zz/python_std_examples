# crypt - Function to check Unix passwords

The `crypt` module in Python is used to provide an interface to Unix-style password hashing functions, which are commonly found in systems like Linux. This module includes a function called `checkpw()` that can be used to verify whether a given password matches the hashed form of a stored password.

Here's a comprehensive example demonstrating how to use the `crypt` module to check passwords:

```python
import crypt

def check_password(stored_hash, plain_text_password):
    """
    Check if the provided plain text password matches the stored hash using the crypt function.
    
    Parameters:
    - stored_hash (str): The hashed password as a string.
    - plain_text_password (str): The plain text password to verify.
    
    Returns:
    - bool: True if the password matches the stored hash, False otherwise.
    """
    # Generate a salt for hashing
    salt = crypt.mksalt()
    
    # Create a password hash using the provided salt and plain text password
    hashed_password = crypt.crypt(plain_text_password, salt)
    
    # Check if the generated hash matches the stored hash
    return hashed_password == stored_hash

# Example usage of the check_password function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example stored password (hashed using crypt.ENC_MD5)
    stored_md5_hash = "$1$u7093lQf$aWJy8sVdLZvKgUxNQzY"
    
    # Plain text password to verify
    plain_text_password = "password123"
    
    # Check if the provided password matches the stored hash
    result = check_password(stored_md5_hash, plain_text_password)
    
    # Print the result
    print(f"Password verification: {'Success' if result else 'Failure'}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Import the `crypt` Module**: The `crypt` module provides access to Unix-style password hashing functions.

2. **Function Definition**: The `check_password()` function takes two parameters:
   - `stored_hash`: The hashed password as a string.
   - `plain_text_password`: The plain text password to verify.

3. **Generate Salt**: A salt is generated using `crypt.mksalt()`. This ensures that each password hash is unique, even if the same password is used in different environments.

4. **Hash Password**: Using the generated salt and the plain text password, a new password hash is created with `crypt.crypt()`.

5. **Comparison**: The function compares the generated hash with the stored hash to determine if they match.

6. **Example Usage**: In the example usage section, we demonstrate how to use the `check_password` function to verify a password against a stored hash using the MD5 algorithm (`crypt.ENC_MD5`). You can replace the salt and hashing method with others available in Python's `crypt` module (e.g., `crypt.ENC_BLOWFISH`, `crypt.ENC_SHA256`) depending on your requirements.

This example is suitable for use in applications where password verification is necessary, such as user authentication systems or secure data storage solutions.
