# resource â€” Resource usage information

Here's an example of using the `resource` module from Python's standard library:

**Resource Module Example**
```python
import os
import resource

# Get the current CPU usage
print("Current CPU usage: ", os.getloadavg())

# Set the priority to high
priority = 0
try:
    # Set the nice value (higher values mean lower priority)
    # Note that this only works on Unix-like systems
    if os.name == 'posix':
        resource.nice(priority)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to set priority: {e}")

# Get the current memory usage
print("Current memory usage: ", os.getresorz()[0])

# Set the limit for virtual memory (in pages)
try:
    # Set the hard limit for virtual memory usage
    # Note that this only works on Unix-like systems
    if os.name == 'posix':
        resource.vmalloclimit(resource.VVMEM, 1024 * 1024 * 10)  # 10 GB
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to set virtual memory limit: {e}")

# Get the current system load
import psutil
load = psutil.cpu_percent()
print("Current CPU usage (with Psutil): ", load)
```

Note that not all functions and constants in the `resource` module are available on all platforms. The above example uses only those functions and constants that are commonly used and supported across multiple platforms.

Here's a more comprehensive list of resources available:

- `os.getloadavg()`: returns the current CPU utilization
- `os.nice(n)`: sets the nice value, which affects priority
- `resource.vmalloclimit(limit, type)`: sets the limit for virtual memory (in pages)

Please note that you need to run this script on Unix-like systems (like Linux or macOS). On Windows, you will get an error when calling `os.nice()`.

**API Documentation:**

Here is a brief API documentation of the resource module:

- `os.getloadavg()`: Returns a tuple containing three values:
    - The load average over the last minute
    - The load average over the last five minutes
    - The load average over the last 15 minutes

- `resource.nice(n)`: Sets the nice value, which affects priority. The value of n is in the range [0, -20].

- `os.vmalloclimit(limit, type)`: Sets the limit for virtual memory (in pages).
