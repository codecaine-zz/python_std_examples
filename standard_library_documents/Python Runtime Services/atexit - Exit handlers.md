# atexit â€” Exit handlers

**atexit Module Code Generator**
=====================================

The `atexit` module provides a way to register functions to be executed when the program exits.

### Example Use Cases

*   Registering functions to release system resources
*   Performing cleanup operations before exiting the program
*   Executing tasks that should only run once, such as sending a shutdown notification

### Code Generation

```python
import atexit
import os
import sys

def register_exit_handler(func):
    """
    Registers a function to be executed when the program exits.
    
    Args:
        func (function): The function to register for exit execution.
    """
    # Use atexit.register to register the function for exit execution
    atexit.register(func)

def print_exit_message(message):
    """
    Prints a message before exiting the program.
    
    Args:
        message (str): The message to print.
    """
    print(f"Exiting program: {message}")

# Register the print_exit_message function to be executed when the program exits
register_exit_handler(print_exit_message)
print_exit_message("Exiting normally")

# Register a function that releases system resources before exiting
def release_resources():
    """
    Releases system resources before exiting.
    """
    # Release file descriptor 0 (stdin) on Unix-like systems
    if os.name == "posix":
        import resource
        resource.release(0)

register_exit_handler(release_resources)
sys.exit()  # Simulate a program exit

# Register the release_resources function to be executed when the program exits via sys.exit()
import signal
def handler(signum, frame):
    """
    Signals that the release_resources function should be called.
    
    Args:
        signum (int): The signal number.
        frame (frame): The current frame.
    """
    signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal.SIG_DFL)
    release_resources()

signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, handler)
sys.exit()  # Simulate a program exit
```

### Explanation

The `atexit` module allows you to register functions to be executed when the program exits. In this example:

*   We define two functions: `print_exit_message` and `release_resources`. The first function prints a message before exiting, while the second function releases system resources before exiting.
*   We use the `register_exit_handler` function to register these functions for exit execution using `atexit.register`.
*   To simulate a program exit without actually running the registered functions, we use `sys.exit()`.
*   When the program exits via `sys.exit()`, the registered functions are executed.
