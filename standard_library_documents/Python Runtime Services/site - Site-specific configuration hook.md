# site â€” Site-specific configuration hook

**Site-Specific Configuration Hook: `site` Module**
=====================================================

The `site` module is a site-specific configuration hook that provides access to the current site's metadata.

**Module Description**
--------------------

The `site` module allows you to register and retrieve information about the current site, including its name, title, and URL. It also provides hooks for customizing the behavior of the module.

**Example Code**
-------------

```python
import site

# Register a new site with its metadata
def register_site(name, url, title):
    """Register a new site with its metadata"""
    # Create a new Site object
    site_obj = site.Site(name, url, title)
    # Register the site object with the current site's registry
    site.register(site_obj)

# Retrieve information about the current site
def get_site_info():
    """Retrieve information about the current site"""
    # Get the current site object from the registry
    current_site = site.get_currentSite()
    # Return a dictionary containing the site's metadata
    return {
        'name': current_site.name,
        'url': current_site.url,
        'title': current_site.title
    }

# Define a custom hook for the `site` module
def custom_hook(site):
    """Customize the behavior of the `site` module"""
    # Print a message indicating that the site has been loaded
    print("Site loaded:", site.name)

# Register the custom hook with the current site's registry
register_site('My Site', 'https://example.com', 'My Awesome Site')
site.register(custom_hook, '')

# Retrieve information about the current site and print it to the console
print(get_site_info())

# Unregister the custom hook from the current site's registry
site.unregister_hook(custom_hook)
```

**Usage**
-----

To use the `site` module, you can import it and access its functions and variables.

*   To register a new site with its metadata, call the `register_site()` function and pass in the site's name, URL, and title as arguments.
*   To retrieve information about the current site, call the `get_site_info()` function and access the returned dictionary containing the site's metadata.
*   To customize the behavior of the `site` module, define a custom hook function that takes a `Site` object as an argument and register it with the current site's registry using the `register_hook()` function.

**Notes**
-----

The `site` module is used to provide access to information about the current site in Python-based applications. It allows you to customize its behavior by registering custom hooks, which can be useful for integrating third-party libraries or frameworks into your application.
