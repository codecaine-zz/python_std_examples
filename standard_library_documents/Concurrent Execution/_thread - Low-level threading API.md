# _thread - Low-level threading API

The `_thread` module in Python is a low-level interface to threading that provides more control over thread management than the higher-level `threading` module. This module is mainly used when you need to write specific types of programs or have very tight requirements on performance.

Below are comprehensive code examples for various functionalities provided by the `_thread` module:

### Example 1: Creating and Starting a Thread

```python
import _thread
import time

# Define a function that will be run in a thread
def worker():
    print(f"Worker started at {time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}")
    for i in range(5):
        print(f"Worker working: {i+1}")
        time.sleep(1)
    print("Worker finished.")

# Create and start a thread
_thread.start_new_thread(worker, ())

# Main program waits for the worker to finish before exiting
time.sleep(6)  # Wait for the thread to complete

print("Main program completed.")
```

**Explanation:**
- This example demonstrates how to create and start a new thread using `_thread.start_new_thread()`.
- The `worker` function is defined and passed as the target function.
- The main program waits for the worker to finish by calling `time.sleep(6)`, which gives enough time for the worker to complete its tasks.

### Example 2: Using Thread Locks

```python
import _thread
import threading
import time  # Add this import

# Define a lock object
lock = threading.Lock()

def worker(lock, name):
    with lock:
        print(f"{name} acquired the lock at {time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}")
        time.sleep(2)
        print(f"{name} released the lock.")

# Create and start threads with different names
_thread.start_new_thread(worker, (lock, "Thread 1"))
_thread.start_new_thread(worker, (lock, "Thread 2"))

# Main program waits for all threads to complete
time.sleep(5)  # Wait long enough for both threads to finish

print("All workers completed.")
```

**Explanation:**
- A `Lock` object is created using `threading.Lock()`.
- The `worker` function acquires the lock using a `with` statement, ensuring that the lock is properly released after the block of code is executed.
- Two threads are started with different names, and they attempt to acquire and release the lock concurrently.

### Example 3: Using Thread Events

```python
import _thread
import threading
import time

# Define an event object
event = threading.Event()

def worker(event):
    while not event.is_set():
        print(f"Worker is waiting for the event.")
        time.sleep(1)
    print("Worker received the event and completed.")

# Start a thread that waits on the event
_thread.start_new_thread(worker, (event,))

# Simulate some work before setting the event
time.sleep(3)

# Set the event to unblock the worker
print("Setting the event...")
event.set()

# Main program waits for the event to be set
time.sleep(2)
print("Event has been set.")
```

**Explanation:**
- An `Event` object is created using `threading.Event()`.
- The `worker` function continuously checks if the event is set. If not, it waits.
- The main program simulates some work and sets the event after a delay, which unblocks the worker thread.

### Example 4: Using Thread Barrier

```python
import _thread
import threading
import time

# Define a barrier object with two parties
barrier = threading.Barrier(2)

def worker(barrier, name):
    print(f"{name} arrived at the barrier at {time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}")
    barrier.wait()
    print(f"{name} passed the barrier.")

# Create and start threads with different names
_thread.start_new_thread(worker, (barrier, "Thread 1"))
_thread.start_new_thread(worker, (barrier, "Thread 2"))

# Main program waits for all threads to pass the barrier
time.sleep(2)  # Give some time for both threads to reach the barrier

print("All workers passed the barrier.")
```

**Explanation:**
- A `Barrier` object is created with two parties using `threading.Barrier(2)`.
- The `worker` function prints a message when it arrives at the barrier and then calls `barrier.wait()`, which blocks until all threads have reached the barrier.
- The main program waits for all threads to pass the barrier.

### Example 5: Using Thread Local Data

```python
import _thread
import threading
import time

# Define a thread local storage object
local_data = threading.local()

def worker(local):
    local.data = "Data from thread"
    print(f"Thread {threading.current_thread().name} set data: {local.data}")

# Start threads and use local data
_thread.start_new_thread(worker, (local_data,))
_thread.start_new_thread(worker, (local_data,))

# Main program waits for all threads to complete
time.sleep(2)  # Wait for the threads to finish

print("All workers completed.")
```

**Explanation:**
- A `ThreadLocal` object is created using `threading.local()`.
- The `worker` function sets a local variable in `local_data` and prints it.
- Each thread uses the same `local_data` object, but each thread has its own separate instance of the variables.

These examples cover various aspects of using the `_thread` module, including creating threads, managing locks, using events, synchronizing with barriers, and utilizing thread-local storage.
