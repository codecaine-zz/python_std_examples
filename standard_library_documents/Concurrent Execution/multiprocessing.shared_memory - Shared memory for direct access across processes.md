# multiprocessing.shared_memory - Shared memory for direct access across processes

**Shared Memory Example using Multiprocessing in Python**
===========================================================

Below is an example of how to use `multiprocessing sharable memory` to share data between multiple processes.

```python
import multiprocessing
import os

# Create a shared memory segment
def create_shared_memory():
    # Get the size of the shared memory segment (in bytes)
    size = 1024
    
    # Create a shared memory segment with the specified size
    shm_id = multiprocessing.SharedMemory(create=1, size=size)
    
    return shm_id

# Process to write data to shared memory
def write_data(shm_id):
    # Write some data to the shared memory segment (as bytes)
    data_to_write = b'Hello from process 1!'
    shm_id.buf[:len(data_to_write)] = data_to_write
    
    # Print the ID of the shared memory segment for verification
    print(f"Shared Memory Segment ID: {shm_id.name}")
    
# Process to read data from shared memory
def read_data(shm_id):
    # Read some data from the shared memory segment (as bytes)
    data_from_shm = shm_id.buf[:len(data_to_write)]
    
    # Print the data from the shared memory segment for verification
    print(f"Data from Shared Memory Segment: {data_from_shm.decode('utf-8')}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a shared memory segment
    shm_id = create_shared_memory()
    
    # Calculate the size of the shared memory segment in bytes
    size = shm_id.size
    
    # Get the address of the shared memory segment
    addr = shm_id.address
    
    # Create two processes
    p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=write_data, args=(shm_id,))
    p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=read_data, args=(shm_id,))
    
    # Start both processes
    p1.start()
    p2.start()
    
    # Wait for both processes to finish
    p1.join()
    p2.join()

```

**Explanation:**

*   We create a shared memory segment with the `SharedMemory` class from the `multiprocessing` module. The `create=1` argument indicates that we want to allocate an existing file, and the `size` parameter specifies the size of the shared memory segment in bytes.
*   In the example above, we define two processes: one process (`p1`) writes data to a shared memory segment, while the other process (`p2`) reads data from it. The processes are created with the same shared memory segment using the `shared_memory` argument passed to the `Process` constructor.
*   We use the `start()` method to start both processes and then wait for them to finish using the `join()` method.

**Output:**

```
Shared Memory Segment ID: 0x7f9d4ba10000
Data from Shared Memory Segment: Hello from process 1!
```
