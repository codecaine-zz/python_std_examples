# pdb - The Python Debugger

Below is a comprehensive set of code examples for the `pdb` module, which provides an interactive command-line interface to interact with running Python programs. Each example includes comments explaining each step.

```python
# Importing the pdb module
import pdb

def simple_function(a, b):
    # Entering the debugger at this point
    pdb.set_trace()

    result = a + b
    return result

# Example usage of simple_function
try:
    print(simple_function(2, 3))
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```

### Explanation:

1. **Importing the `pdb` Module**:
   ```python
   import pdb
   ```
   This line imports the `pdb` module, which is used for debugging purposes.

2. **Defining a Function with Debugging Point**:
   ```python
   def simple_function(a, b):
       # Entering the debugger at this point
       pdb.set_trace()

       result = a + b
       return result
   ```
   - `pdb.set_trace()` is called to set a breakpoint in the function. This means execution will pause whenever the function is called.

3. **Example Usage of the Function**:
   ```python
   try:
       print(simple_function(2, 3))
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
   ```
   - The function `simple_function` is called with arguments `2` and `3`.
   - Since there's a breakpoint in the function, execution will pause at that point.

### Debugging Commands:

When you run the script and hit the breakpoint, you can use various commands to interactively debug the code. Here are some common debugging commands:

- **Commands**:
  - `n` (next): Continue execution until the next line of code is reached.
  - `s` (step into): Step into a function call.
  - `c` (continue): Continue execution until the program finishes or hits another breakpoint.
  - `q` (quit): Exit the debugger and terminate the program.

### Full Example with Debugging:

Here's an example that includes these debugging commands:

```python
# Importing the pdb module
import pdb

def divide(a, b):
    # Entering the debugger at this point
    pdb.set_trace()

    result = a / b
    return result

# Example usage of divide function with some test cases
try:
    print(divide(10, 2))  # Expected output: 5.0
    print(divide(10, 0))  # Expected to trigger an exception
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### Explanation:

- **Handling Division by Zero**:
  - The function `divide` is called with `10` and `0`, which will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.
  - The debugger will pause at the `a / b` line, allowing you to inspect variables and use debugging commands.

By following these examples and using the provided debugging commands, you can effectively use the `pdb` module to debug Python programs.
