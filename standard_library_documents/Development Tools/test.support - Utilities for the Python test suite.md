# test.support â€” Utilities for the Python test suite

**test.support Module**
======================

The `test.support` module provides various utilities and tools for the Python test suite.

### Importing the Module

```python
import unittest
from test import support
```

### 1. SubTest Class

The `SubTest` class allows you to create a sub-test that can fail independently of the parent test case.

```python
# Create a SubTest object
sub_test = support.SubTest()

# Run some setup code within the sub-test
with sub_test.context():
    # Setup code here...
    pass

# Now you can use the setup code and assert statements within the sub-test
with sub_test.assert_called_once_with("some_arg"):
    # Code that calls the function being tested with "some_arg"
    pass
```

### 2. test.cases.TestCase Class

The `TestCase` class is a base class for creating test cases in Python.

```python
class MyTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.setup_code()

    def test_my_method(self):
        # Test code here...
        self.assertEqual(my_function(), "some_value")
```

### 3. test.result.TestResult Class

The `TestResult` class is used to report the results of tests.

```python
class MyTestResult(support.TestResult):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):

        # Initialize any custom attributes you need here...

test_result = MyTestResult()
# Use test_result to report test results
```

### 4. test.discovery.Discover Class
