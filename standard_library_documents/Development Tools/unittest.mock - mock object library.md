# unittest.mock â€” mock object library

Here's an example of how you can use `unittest.mock` to mock objects in your tests:

```python
import unittest
from unittest import mock
from your_module import YourClass  # Import the class you want to test

class TestYourClass(unittest.TestCase):

    @mock.patch('your_module.your_function')
    def test_your_function(self, mock_your_function):
        """
        Mocking a function and verifying its behavior.
        
        In this example, we're mocking `your_function` from `your_module`.
        We then call the mocked function and verify that it was called with
        the correct arguments.
        """
        mock_your_function.return_value = 'Mocked return value'
        your_class = YourClass()
        result = your_class.your_function()
        self.assertEqual(result, 'Mocked return value')

    @mock.patch('your_module.your_other_function')
    def test_your_other_function(self, mock_your_other_function):
        """
        Mocking another function and verifying its behavior.
        
        In this example, we're mocking `your_other_function` from `your_module`.
        We then call the mocked function and verify that it was called with
        the correct arguments and returned the expected value.
        """
        mock_your_other_function.return_value = 'Mocked return value'
        your_class = YourClass()
        result = your_class.your_other_function()
        self.assertEqual(result, 'Mocked return value')

    @mock.patch('your_module.YourClass')
    def test_inheritance(self, mock_YourClass):
        """
        Mocking a class and verifying its behavior.
        
        In this example, we're mocking `YourClass` from `your_module`.
        We then create an instance of the mocked class and verify that it
        behaves as expected.
        """
        mock_YourClass.return_value = YourClass()
        your_class = mock_YourClass.return_value
        self.assertIsInstance(your_class, YourClass)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this example, we're using `@mock.patch` to create a mock object for `your_function` and verify its behavior. We're also mocking another function and verifying that it behaves as expected.

Here are some key things to note:

*   The `@mock.patch` decorator is used to create a mock object for the specified module or function.
*   You can use the `return_value` attribute of the mock object to specify the value that should be returned when the mocked function is called.
*   You can use the `side_effect` attribute of the mock object to specify the value(s) that should be returned when the mocked function is called multiple times or raises an exception.
*   The `assertIsInstance` method is used to verify that a mock object behaves like the original class.

**Mocking Exceptions**

You can also use `@mock.patch` to mock exceptions:

```python
@mock.patch('your_module.your_function')
def test_your_function(self, mock_your_function):
    """
    Mocking an exception and verifying its behavior.
    
    In this example, we're mocking `your_function` from `your_module`.
    We then call the mocked function and verify that it raises the expected exception.
    """
    mock_your_function.side_effect = Exception('Mocked exception')
    with self.assertRaises(Exception):
        your_class.your_function()
```

In this example, we're using the `side_effect` attribute of the mock object to specify an exception. We then use a `with` statement to ensure that the mocked function raises the expected exception.

**Mocking Methods**

You can also use `@mock.patch` to mock methods:

```python
class TestYourClass(unittest.TestCase):

    @mock.patch('your_module.your_class')
    def test_your_method(self, mock_your_class):
        """
        Mocking a method and verifying its behavior.
        
        In this example, we're mocking the `your_method` of `your_class`.
        We then call the mocked method and verify that it behaves as expected.
        """
        mock_your_class.return_value.your_method.return_value = 'Mocked return value'
        your_class = YourClass()
        result = your_class.your_method()
        self.assertEqual(result, 'Mocked return value')

    @mock.patch('your_module.YourClass')
    def test_inheritance(self, mock_YourClass):
        """
        Mocking a method and verifying its behavior.
        
        In this example, we're mocking the `your_method` of `YourClass`.
        We then create an instance of the mocked class and verify that it
        behaves as expected.
        """
        mock_YourClass.return_value.your_method.return_value = 'Mocked return value'
        your_class = mock_YourClass.return_value
        self.assertEqual(your_class.your_method(), 'Mocked return value')
```

In this example, we're using the `return_value` attribute of the mock object to specify a value for the mocked method. We then call the mocked method and verify that it behaves as expected.

**Resetting Mocks**

After a test has completed, you may want to reset the mocks to restore their original state:

```python
@mock.patch('your_module.your_function')
def test_your_function(self, mock_your_function):
    """
    Mocking an object and verifying its behavior.
    
    In this example, we're mocking `your_function` from `your_module`.
    We then call the mocked function and verify that it behaves as expected.
    After the test completes, we reset the mock to restore its original state.
    """
    mock_your_function.return_value = 'Mocked return value'
    your_class = YourClass()
    result = your_class.your_function()
    self.assertEqual(result, 'Mocked return value')
    mock_your_function.assert_called_once_with('some_args')
```

In this example, we're using the `assert_called_once_with` method to verify that the mocked function was called once with the correct arguments. After the test completes, we're using the `assert_called_once_with` method again to ensure that the mock is in its original state.

**Using a Mock Factory**

Instead of creating mocks directly, you can use a mock factory to create mocks programmatically:

```python
@mock.patch('your_module.your_function', side_effect=Exception('Mocked exception'))
def test_your_function(self):
    """
    Using a mock factory to create a mock object.
    
    In this example, we're using the `@mock.patch` decorator to create a mock
    object for `your_function`. We then use the `@patch.object` context manager
    to patch the `your_function` attribute of `your_class`.
    """
    with patch.object(YourClass, 'your_function', side_effect=Exception('Mocked exception')):
        your_class = YourClass()
        result = your_class.your_function()
        self.assertEqual(result, Exception('Mocked exception'))
```

In this example, we're using the `@patch.object` context manager to create a mock object for `your_function`. We then use the `side_effect` attribute of the mock object to specify an exception.
