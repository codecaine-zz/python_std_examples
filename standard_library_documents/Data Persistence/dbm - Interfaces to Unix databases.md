# dbm - Interfaces to Unix “databases”

Here's an example of how you can use the dbm module in Python:

```python
# Importing the dbm module
import dbm

# Connecting to a DBM file
try:
    # Specify the path to your DBM file
    conn = dbm.open('example.db', 'r')
except dbm.Error as e:
    print(f"Failed to open the database: {e}")
    exit(1)

# Creating a new key-value pair in the DBM file
conn.set ('key', 'value')

# Retrieving values from the DBM file
print(conn.get ('key'))

# Removing a value from the DBM file
conn.delete ('key')

# Closing the connection to the DBM file
conn.close()

# Iterating over all keys and values in the DBM file
for key, value in conn.items():
    print(f"Key: {key}, Value: {value}")

# Using dbm.open() with multiple arguments (creating a new DBM file)
try:
    conn = dbm.open('example.db', 'w')
except dbm.Error as e:
    print(f"Failed to create the database: {e}")
    exit(1)

# Adding more key-value pairs
conn.set ('new_key', 'new_value')

# Committing changes
conn.commit()

# Rolling back changes
conn.rollback()
```

Here's an example of how you can use dbm's transactional functionality:

```python
import dbm

try:
    # Connect to the database file
    conn = dbm.open('example.db', 'r')
except dbm.Error as e:
    print(f"Failed to open the database: {e}")
    exit(1)

# Start a transaction
conn.start()

try:
    # Perform operations within the transaction
    conn.set ('key', 'value')
    conn.delete ('other_key')

    # Commit changes
    conn.commit()
except dbm.Error as e:
    print(f"Transaction failed: {e}")
else:
    # Rollback changes if no exception occurs
    conn.rollback()

# Close the connection to the database file
conn.close()
```

This example shows how you can use the dbm module to interact with Unix "databases". These databases are essentially in-memory data stores that contain key-value pairs. The `open()` function is used to connect to these files, and methods like `set()`, `get()`, `delete()`, and `items()` allow you to read and write from the database.
