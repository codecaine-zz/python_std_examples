# difflib - Helpers for computing deltas

Below is a comprehensive set of code examples demonstrating various functionalities provided by the `difflib` module, which is part of Python's standard library and helps in comparing sequences to find differences. Each example includes detailed comments explaining what the code does.

```python
import difflib

# Example 1: Basic Sequence Comparison
original = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
modified = "The fast brown fox leaped over the sleepy hound"

# Create a Differ object to compare two sequences (strings in this case)
differ = difflib.Differ()

# Get a list of differences between original and modified strings
diffs = list(differ.compare(original.split(), modified.split()))

print("Differences (simple):")
for diff in diffs:
    print(diff)

# Example 2: Context Format Differences
context_differ = difflib.ContextDiff(original.split(), modified.split())
context_diffs = list(context_differ)

print("\nDifferences (context format):")
for diff in context_diffs:
    print(diff)

# Example 3: Html Format Differences
html_differ = difflib.HtmlDiff()
html_diffs = html_differ.make_file(original.splitlines(), modified.splitlines())

with open("diff.html", "w") as f:
    for line in html_diffs:
        f.write(line)
print("\nDifferences (HTML format) written to diff.html")

# Example 4: SequenceMatcher - Comparing Similarity
text1 = """The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"""
text2 = """A fast brown fox leaped over a drowsy hound"""

matcher = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, text1.split(), text2.split())

print("\nSimilarity Score:", matcher.ratio())  # Output: Similarity score between 0 and 1

# Example 5: Find Matches in Two Sequences
sequence_a = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
sequence_b = "A fast brown fox leaped over a drowsy hound"

matcher = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, sequence_a.split(), sequence_b.split())

for tag, i1, i2, j1, j2 in matcher.get_opcodes():
    if tag == 'equal':  # Lines that are equal
        print("Equal:", (i1, i2), " - ", sequence_a[i1:i2])
    elif tag == 'insert':  # New lines in b
        print("Insert:", (j1, j2), " - ", sequence_b[j1:j2])
    elif tag == 'delete':  # Removed lines from a
        print("Delete:", (i1, i2), " - ", sequence_a[i1:i2])
    elif tag == 'replace':  # Replaced lines in both sequences
        print("Replace:", (i1, i2), " to ", (j1, j2), " - ", sequence_a[i1:i2], " -> ", sequence_b[j1:j2])

# Example 6: Get Close Matches Using SequenceMatcher
word_list = ["dog", "cat", "tiger", "lion", "fox"]
search_word = "foxe"

matches = difflib.get_close_matches(search_word, word_list, n=3, cutoff=0.8)

print("\nClose matches to 'foxe':")
for match in matches:
    print(match)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Basic Sequence Comparison**: The `Differ` class is used to compare two sequences (strings) and output the differences line by line.

2. **Context Format Differences**: The `ContextDiff` class provides a context format for the differences, which includes additional context lines around changes.

3. **Html Format Differences**: Generates an HTML representation of the differences that can be saved to a file or displayed in web browsers.

4. **SequenceMatcher - Comparing Similarity**: Measures the similarity between two sequences using `SequenceMatcher`. It returns a ratio ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 means identical and 0 means no common elements.

5. **Find Matches in Two Sequences**: Uses `get_opcodes` method of `SequenceMatcher` to find insertions, deletions, replacements, and equal parts between two sequences.

6. **Get Close Matches Using SequenceMatcher**: Finds close matches for a word within a list of words using the `get_close_matches` function, which is useful in spell-checking or autocomplete features.

These examples should cover most common use cases where you need to compare sequences or find differences in Python programs.
