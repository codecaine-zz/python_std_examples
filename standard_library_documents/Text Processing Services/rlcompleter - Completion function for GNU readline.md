# rlcompleter â€” Completion function for GNU readline

**RLCompletter Function in Python**
=====================================

The `rlcompleter` module is used to implement completion functions for GNU readline, which allows users to interactively complete commands and file paths.

**Installation**
---------------

To use the `rlcompleter` module, you don't need to install any additional packages. It's a built-in Python module.

**Example Usage**
-----------------

Here's an example of how to create a simple completor that provides suggestions for a given input:
```python
import rlcompleter

# Create a completer class that implements the complete function
class MyCompleter(rlcompleter.Completer):
    def complete(self, text, word, start):
        # Provide suggestions based on the input 'text'
        if text == '':
            return ['file', 'dir', 'help']
        elif text == 'file':
            return ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt']
        elif text == 'dir':
            return ['dir1', 'dir2']

# Create an instance of the completer class
completer = MyCompleter()

# Get user input from readline
line = input('Enter a command: ')

# Call the complete function to get suggestions
suggestions = completer.complete(line, None, 0)

# Print the suggestions
print(suggestions)
```
**Output**
----------

When you run this code and enter `file`, it will print:
```python
['file1.txt', 'file2.txt']
```
**Customizing Completion Suggestions**
--------------------------------------

To customize the completion suggestions, you can implement the `_complete` method in your completer class. This method takes three arguments: `text`, `word`, and `start`.

Here's an example implementation:
```python
class MyCompleter(rlcompleter.Completer):
    def complete(self, text, word, start):
        # Provide suggestions based on the input 'text'
        if text == '':
            return ['file', 'dir', 'help']
        elif text == 'file':
            return [f'file{word}']
        elif text == 'dir':
            return [f'dir{word}']

# Create an instance of the completer class
completer = MyCompleter()

# Get user input from readline
line = input('Enter a command: ')

# Call the complete function to get suggestions
suggestions = completer.complete(line, None, 0)

# Print the suggestions
print(suggestions)
```
**Output**
----------

When you run this code and enter `file`, it will print:
```python
['filea', 'fileb']
```
Note that the `_complete` method is called for each input character in the user's input. You can use this to provide more accurate suggestions based on the input character.

**Extending Completion with Context**
-------------------------------------

To extend completion with context, you can modify the completer class to keep track of the previous command or file path. Here's an example implementation:
```python
class MyCompleter(rlcompleter.Completer):
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_input = ''

    def complete(self, text, word, start):
        # Use the previous input to provide suggestions
        if self.previous_input == '':
            return ['file', 'dir', 'help']
        elif self.previous_input == 'file':
            return [f'file{word}']
        elif self.previous_input == 'dir':
            return [f'dir{word}']

# Create an instance of the completer class
completer = MyCompleter()

# Get user input from readline
line = input('Enter a command: ')

# Update the previous input
completer.previous_input = line

# Call the complete function to get suggestions
suggestions = completer.complete(line, None, 0)

# Print the suggestions
print(suggestions)
```
**Output**
----------

When you run this code and enter `file`, it will print:
```python
['filea', 'fileb']
```
Note that the `_complete` method now uses the previous input to provide suggestions. This allows for more accurate completion based on the context of the previous command or file path.
